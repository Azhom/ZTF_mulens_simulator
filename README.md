# Probing microlensing with Fink

This repo contains various notebook to study the microlensing in the light of
the Fink broker:
- [step 0](step0_ztf_simulation.ipynb): Simulate microlensing using ZTF DR2 light-curves
- [step 1](step1_training.ipynb): Construct models using [LIA](https://github.com/dgodinez77/LIA)
- [step 2](step2_lc_exploration.ipynb): test the classifier on full light-curves and partial light-curves. We focus on the accuracy, the evolution of score over time, and Early Detection Capabilities.
- [step 3](step3_real_data.ipynb): Question the role of brokers with respect to data release, by focusing on one particular event, ZTF19aainwvb.

A summary of the results can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Te6aFJvHTysyEqJ8I7yQ5o1SEek864ddaFrrGYVDkww/edit?usp=sharing).
